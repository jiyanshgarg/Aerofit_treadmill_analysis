# Business-Case-Aerofit--Descriptive-Statistics-Probability
Welcome to the Aerofit Descriptive Statistics & Probability project repository! 

## About Aerofit
Aerofit is not just a fitness equipment brand; it's a lifestyle! We provide a wide range of fitness products, including top-notch treadmills, exercise bikes, gym equipment, and all the fitness accessories you need. We're here to cater to the diverse fitness needs of people from all walks of life.

## Business Problem
The brilliant minds at AeroFit have a mission: to understand our customers better and provide tailored treadmill recommendations to newcomers. To do this, we're diving deep into data to find out if there are specific characteristics that differentiate our treadmill products. Our journey consists of two main goals:

Perform descriptive analytics to craft unique customer profiles for each AeroFit treadmill product, illustrated through compelling tables and charts.

Create two-way contingency tables and calculate conditional and marginal probabilities, shining a light on how these insights impact our business.

## The Data 
- Product Purchased: KP281, KP481, or KP781
- Age: In years
- Gender: Male/Female
- Education: In years
- Marital Status: Single or partnered
- Usage: How often the treadmill is used weekly
- Income: Annual income (in $)
- Fitness: Self-rated fitness on a scale from 1 (poor shape) to 5 (excellent shape)
- Miles: The average number of miles expected to be walked/run each week

## Product Portfolio 
Here's a quick overview of our treadmill products:

A) KP281: Entry-level treadmill at $1,500.
B) KP481: Mid-level runner's choice at $1,750.
C) KP781: Advanced treadmill with all the bells and whistles at $2,500.

## Performed following Tasks
- Import the dataset and do usual data analysis steps like checking the structure & characteristics of the dataset
- Detect Outliers (using boxplot, “describe” method by checking the difference between mean and median)
- Check if features like marital status, age have any effect on the product purchased (using countplot, histplots, boxplots etc)
- Representing the marginal probability like - what percent of customers have purchased KP281, KP481, or KP781 in a table (can use pandas.crosstab here)
- Check correlation among different factors using heat maps or pair plots.
- With all the above steps you can answer questions like: What is the probability of a male customer buying a KP781 treadmill?
- Customer Profiling - Categorization of users.
- Probability- marginal, conditional probability.
- Some recommendations and actionable insights, based on the inferences.
